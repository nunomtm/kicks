The financial institution will then charge you “interest” on the money borrowed.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,
    &quot;futureValue&quot;: &quot;&lt;h3&gt;What is Future Value Financing?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future Value Financing is a great alternative to a traditional purchase financing or leasing. With the Future Value Financing option, you get to take advantage of a lower monthly payment and have the advantage of owning your vehicle with no kilometers restrictions just like traditional purchase finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How does Future Value Financing Work?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You purchase the vehicle and finance it using a Future Value Financing contract through a financial institution. The term of your finance contract is 60 months (5 years) but it is amortized over 84 months (7 years). This allows you to have a lower monthly payment. Your payment schedule is structured using a consecutive monthly payment for the 60 months (5 years) and a balloon payment at the end of your contract (which is the amount remaining on the loan). At the end of the contract term, you have 3 options for paying the balloon payment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Refinance the outstanding balancing owing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Purchase the vehicle by paying the outstanding balance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trade the vehicle in towards the lease or purchase of a new Hyundai vehicle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&quot;,

  &quot;PrivacyPolicyText&quot;: &quot;PRIVACY POLICY\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nHyundai Auto Canada Corp. (\&quot;Hyundai\&quot;) respects your privacy and will strive to protect the confidentiality of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains our policies and practices including why we collect your personal information, how we use it and how we safeguard it. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and if you do not agree with it, please do not provide us with any personal information.\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWhy does Hyundai Collect Personal Information?\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nWe collect your personal information in order to: (a) maintain our records to provide you with warranty or other customer service communications; (b) advise you of any product recalls or customer notifications with respect to your vehicle; (c) provide you with marketing, product information and service offers that may be of interest to you, including targeted content online; (d) provide you with services you request and to respond to your comments or requests for information; (e) conduct market and product preference research and analysis; and, (f) meet our legal obligations and other legitimate business interests.\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nWhat Personal Information Does Hyundai Collect and How Does Hyundai Collect It?\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nHyundai collects personal information about you that is reasonably necessary for the purposes described above. We collect information that will enable us to identify you such as your name, address, e-mail address and telephone number. We may also collect certain demographical information such as family status and purchase preferences. \r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe may collect this information directly from you or from our service providers and dealers. When required by law, your personal information is only collected with your consent. For example, we collect financial and credit information about you shared with us by our third party financial service providers when you have provided your consent. When you purchase or lease a vehicle, a Hyundai dealer will collect information about you that will be shared with Hyundai for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. The collection of information shall be subject to any additional terms provided at the time of such transaction. \r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nHyundai may also use technology together with your profile information, such as your purchase history, preferences and/or contact information, to provide you with targeted, interest-based and/or behavioral content and advertising and may conduct such activities, as well as data analytics in this respect, in conjunction with third party service providers, social media platforms or other entities. Hyundai and/or other entities, such as ad network providers, publishers and other media entities, may use cookies or other tracking methods to gather information, or otherwise have access to information about you, and may target content to you based on this information and your profile information on various platforms and media. You may choose to alter the settings of your browser to turn off cookies. To opt-out of online advertising programs that track your activities online, visit Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada, NAI opt-out page, the AD Choices Opt-out page and/or any other similarly applicable organization. Opting out in this manner will not prevent advertising from appearing online, but such advertising will not be targeted based on your activities and interests. \r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nHyundai conducts contests and offers promotions from time to time and offers services such as vehicle warranty, servicing and maintenance. You may be required to provide certain contact and other information such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, age, and other information that may be required to provide or administer these services or promotions. \r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you do not want us to use this information to contact you for sales or marketing purposes, please call us toll free at 1-888-216-2626 (English or French) Monday to Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST.\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nElectronic Data Recorders\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nYour vehicle may contain an event data recorder (EDR), which can collect and store information about your vehicle and its occupants immediately before and during a collision or near collision event. This information may include information on how various systems in the vehicle were operating, including parameters such as how far the driver was depressing the accelerator or brake pedal, vehicle speed, steering, the use of the front seat belts, as well as diagnostic information and information about the deployment of the airbags and seat belt pretensioners.\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nVisiting the Hyundai Website\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nYou are free to visit the Hyundai website to see and read information about our company and products without providing us with any personal information. We may collect non-personally identifiable information relating to your use of the Hyundai website and e-mails sent by Hyundai, such as which pages you access, which links you clicked, the date and time of your access, information about the internet browser used, your internet service provider and the website from which you accessed our website. If collected, this information will be used to assist us to perform analyses of activity on our website, which we use to help us improve the website. \r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIn order to provide you with services offered through our website and requested by you (e.g., setting up a test drive or receiving updates from us) we may require that you provide certain personal information. By providing us with such information you are consenting to the collection, use and disclosure by us, our dealers and our service providers of the information as required to provide the requested service. Unless you request us not to do so, you also agree that personal information provided by you may be used by us and disclosed to our dealers and service providers for the purpose of including you in advertising and marketing programs designed to increase awareness of Hyundai products and services which we, our dealers and/or service providers believe will be of interest to you. For example, we may send you such things as information concerning promotional offers. \r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nOur website may contain links to other websites. We urge you to review the privacy statements of each website that you visit to ensure that you understand when, how and why those websites use and share your personal information. Hyundai makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy, completeness, or authenticity of any information contained in any such linked website, including the website’s privacy statements or data handling practices. Any link to any other person or entity’s website should not in any manner be construed as endorsement by Hyundai of such person or entity&#39;s website, products or services. \r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nYour use of our website constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy and any modifications thereto in effect. If the terms of this Privacy Policy are at any time unacceptable to you, do not provide us with any personal information through our website.\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nHow Does Hyundai Share Personal Information?\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nHyundai may share your personal information with our dealers, affiliates and service providers. Hyundai may also share your personal information with our service providers for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Before we share your information with any third party, we will obtain your consent as required by applicable law. For example, we may share your personal information with our service providers exclusively for the purpose of providing services for us (e.g., to fulfill your request to enter into a Hyundai contest). We require that our service providers that have access to your personal information keep the information confidential and they are not permitted to use your personal information for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are providing to us. \r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWe may also disclose your information as required by law.\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nInformation May Be Located Outside of Canada\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nThird party service providers to whom we disclose personal information pursuant to this policy may be located outside of Canada. If our service provider is located in a foreign jurisdiction they are bound by the laws of the country in which they are located. As a result, they may be required to disclose your personal information in response to demands from government authorities, law enforcement, or courts of their jurisdictions.\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nRetention of Personal Information\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe length of time we keep your personal information varies depending on the services being provided to you. We have retention standards that meet customer service, legal and regulatory needs as well as our internal record retention practices.\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nAccuracy and Updating Personal Information\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nWe take care to ensure that the information we have is accurate and up-to-date. However, we also rely on you to tell us when your personal information changes. You can access, update and correct errors in your personally identifiable information by contacting us at 1.888.216.2626 or by clicking on “Update My Communication Preferences” on the bottom of this page. Depending on the nature of the information you are requesting and the complexity of your request, we may ask you to put your request in writing.\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nHyundai Safeguards Your Personal Information\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nHyundai is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information in compliance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.
